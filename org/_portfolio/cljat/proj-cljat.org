I've been working on this toy project to learn Clojure lately fianlly
there is a walking skeleton I can put it out there. 

Here is the live demo running on an EC2 instance: [[http://ec2-52-38-68-204.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080][Live Demo]]

{% include gallery %}

Features:
- Realtime messaging with Websocket
- Scalable with Redis' PUB/SUB across web server nodes
- React Clojurescript front-end application with Reagent

Nice to have in the future:
- More powerful messaging protocols
- User profiles features
- Messages history searching support with ElasticSearch or Solr
- API and Native mobile client

I'll be sharing some things I've leant while working on this project
in this [[http:/dev/portfolio/cljat-details/][Post]]
